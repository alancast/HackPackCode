# IRTurret

This turret is named Turrt and has the following functionality.

He is passcode protected. He will not listen to any commands until the correct passcode is entered. If you enter the correct passcode he will nod yes, and you can use him. If not he will nod no and continue to ignore you.

If you press `OK` he will just fire one dart.

If pressing `1` he will nod yes.

If pressing `2` he will nod no.

If pressing `3` he will look up to the sky and joyously spin in each direction.

If pressing `4` he will turn around, stick his butt up in the air at you, shake it at you then turn back around. He's goofy.

If you press `0` he lets you select the number of darts he should fire. The next number you press is how many he will fire in a row. 0 through 6 are allowed inputs.

If you press `#` he will play a number guessing game with you! He will chose a random number between 0 and 9 and you will have 3 guesses to get it! If you fail a guess he will nod no and let you guess again. If you fail all 3 guesses he will fire a dart at you because you lost! If you guess correctly he will nod yes and the game ends. Press `#` to play it again.

If you press `*` he will lock himself back down until his passcode is re-entered.
